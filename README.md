Project: Spatial Omics Visualization - Diseased vs. Non-Diseased Kidney

Description:
This repository contains an independent project to practice spatial data visualization in
Python. Using publicly available spatial transcriptomics data, it compares the expression
of specific cell types and marker genes in diseased and non-diseased kidney samples.

Note:
This project is purely for educational purposes and is not intended for publication. The aim
is to develop skills in handling and visualizing spatial transcriptomics data.

Kidney_Spatial_Omics.py: Python script for analyzing and visualizing spatial transcriptomics data. The script includes:

Subsetting diseased and non-diseased samples.

Plotting cell type clusters.

Visualizing spatial expression of specific cell types and genes.

Data Source: The dataset is derived from the study:
